Introduction
-----------------

Pre-print paper:

`Catalysis-in-a-Box: A Micro-flow Catalytic Reactor Integrated within a Gas Chromatograph for Automated Kinetic Measurements`__

The :doc:`ch_parser` module has functions for parsing CH files

The :doc:`utils` module has fucntions related to peak detection and analysis

The README document has an example usage and step by step figures of the analysis:
